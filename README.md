# Mae

**The next generation of your Control Center**

•ᴗ•

**Note:** Using DragonMake with dragon doesn't work. I left it in just in case I can get it to work

## TODO

- Finish the code for showing modules
- Add default modules (how to do toggles??) (settings for some modules) (style-based settings)
- Add more styles (Preferences for each?)
- Pack Localizations into MaeUI

## License

As most other repositories, this one has code licensed by the MIT License.

... But, if you would like to credit me, that would be greatly appreciated ❤️
